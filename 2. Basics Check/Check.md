# Basics Check

Create a nested loop that prints out the numbers 10 to 1 each their own number of times (i.e., 10 gets printed 10 times, 9 gets printed 9 times, etc.).

Your output should look like this:

```
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 
7 7 7 7 7 7 7 
6 6 6 6 6 6 
5 5 5 5 5
4 4 4 4
3 3 3
2 2
1
```

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
