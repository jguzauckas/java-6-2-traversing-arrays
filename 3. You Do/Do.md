# You Do

Complete the `repeatLetters` method as describe below.

`repeatLetters` takes two parameters: a `String` `str` and an `int` `repeat`. Given this information, it will duplicate each and every character in the `String` `str` a `repeat` number of times. Here are some examples and the expected printed output:

- `repeatLetters("Hi", 3)` --> `"HHHiii"`
- `repeatLetters("Hello", 2)` --> "`HHeelllloo"`
- `repeatLetters("Hello, World!", 2)` --> `"HHeelllloo,,  WWoorrlldd!!"`
- `repeatLetters("What's up?", 1)` --> `"What's up?"`

Notice in the last example that the value of `repeat` would be `1`, and so the result isn't any different because we only wrote each character once.

Remember, your method should print, not return!

There are some preloaded tests in the `main` method to tell whether or not it is working or not. Use this to test your code.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
