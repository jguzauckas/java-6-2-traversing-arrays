# AP Computer Science A - Unit 6 Section 2

# Traversing Arrays

Now that we have established arrays and the basics of working with them, we can start to work on how efficiently we use them. Just like traversing `String` objects, we can traverse arrays to simplify working with large amounts of information.

This section covers the following material:

- The Need for Array Traversal
- Array Traversal
- Using Array Traversal

To use this repository, start with the `notes.md` document, referencing the various `.java` documents as you go to see the examples in action.

Once you have completed the assignment, save the Java files and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
