# Initial Try

In `Try.java`, there is an incomplete nested `for` loop trying to print out the numbers from 5 to 1 each 5 times.

Complete the `for` loops so that they successfully print out the numbers. The output should look like this:

```
5 5 5 5 5
4 4 4 4 4
3 3 3 3 3
2 2 2 2 2
1 1 1 1 1
```

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
